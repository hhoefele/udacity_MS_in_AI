Current Nanodegree:  AI Programming with Python

Lessons Completed today: 
	Course 2: Beginner Python PCEP Certification Preop
	Lesson 3 Python Control Flow and Loops

Reflection:
	Nesting Conditional Statements
	Range Functions with for and while loops
	Nested Loops
	Loop Control: Break / Continue

Most Interesting Learning(s):  
#1.	Looking up item in list, break when found

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "grapefruit"]
search_item = "cherry"
for fruit in fruits:
	if fruit == search_item:
		#print(fruit)
		print(f"Found: {search_item}")
		break

#2. Getting combinations with nested loops

for i in range(3):
	for j in range(3):
		if i ==	j:
			continue
		if i + j == 2:
			break
		print (f"i: {i}, j: {j}")

print("-------")

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i,j)
